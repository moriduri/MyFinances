1. Create base Dialog class for AddCategory and AddTransaction classes since they are very similar and even share the same interface
2. Add parent category to the category class (also make out a way to get this from dialog, should be combolist for now but will be a special SelectCategory widget whcih will be also used in Transaction class)
3. Link adding with actual saving to the database.
