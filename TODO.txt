1. Add parent category to the category class (also make out a way to get this from dialog, should be combolist for now but will be a special SelectCategory widget whcih will be also used in Transaction class)
2. Save transactions to database.
3. Link signals directly in adding. Now we have this: SIGNAL ButtonBox.accepted() -> SLOT CategoryDialog.accepted() -> SIGNAL CategoryDialog.accepted(QString) -> SLOT CategoriesView.accepted(QString) -> SIGNAL CategoriesView.accepted(QString) -> SLOT MainWindow.AddCategoryToDatabase(QString).
	We can connect signals without intermediate slots instead
4. Create widgets on forms for AddCategory and AddTransactions.
	We can add these widgets to the ui of the parent class.
	This approach allows using Qt Designer for designing these forms which is a more convenient way of creating UI than direct Widget manipulation in code.
